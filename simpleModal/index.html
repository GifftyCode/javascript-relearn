            <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
            <p>With less than a month to go before the European Union enacts new consumer privacy laws for its citizens,
                companies around the world are updating their terms of service agreements to comply.</p>
            <p>The European Unionâ€™s General Data Protection Regulation (G.D.P.R.) goes into effect on May 25 and is
                meant to ensure a common set of data rights in the European Union. It requires organizations to notify
                users as soon as possible of high-risk data breaches that could personally affect them.</p>
